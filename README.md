# EllpiseMover
EllipseMover is a robotics project developed for Camp Petica, combining programming, mechanics and robotics. The project revolves around a robot that is controlled with a dedicated controller and possesses the  ability to pick up colored balls and move them around.

The main objective of EllipseMover was to engage us in an interactive and hands-on learning experience. Through this project, we have gained valuable insights into robotics, programming, and problem-solving. We have had the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of robotics while developing our motor skills, logical thinking, and creativity.

The unique feature of EllipseMover lies in its capability to interact with colored balls. We learnt how to control the robot using the controller, commanding it to pick up balls of various colors and navigate them through a designated play area. This hands-on experience allowed us to explore concepts such as object manipulation, sensor integration, and motion control.

Throughout the project, we also delved into the fundamentals of programming, as we were involved in writing code to control EllipseMover's movements and interactions. By understanding the programming logic behind the robot's actions, we developed better problem-solving skills and foster a deeper understanding of computational thinking.

We have also had the opportunity to work in groups, encouraging us to communicate effectively, share ideas, and solve challenges together. The collaborative environment has enhanced our social skills and promoted a sense of achievement through teamwork.

By the end of the camp, we achieved the satisfaction of having built and programmed our own robot, capable of picking up and moving colored balls with precision and control.
